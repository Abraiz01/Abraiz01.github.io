# Project #3 - Sound Project
Project #3 creating a sound-based story using Audacity, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Working Link: [The Scam](https://abraiz01.github.io/CommunicationsLab/soundProject/)

## Project Description

"The Scam!" is a project that takes the form of a 2-3 minute sound piece designed to be hosted on a website. The overall concept of the project is to raise awareness about the dangers of online scamming by taking the listener on a journey that simulates a real-life experience of being scammed. The project aims to create an immersive experience that showcases the prevalence and impact of online scamming while also educating the audience on how to protect themselves against such scams. The theme of the project is centered around online scamming, a serious issue that has become increasingly prevalent in today's digital age. 

The story follows the journey of a protagonist who is scammed by someone pretending to be a UAE bank manager. Through this narrative, the project aims to highlight the danger of online scamming, how it can happen to anyone, and the importance of being vigilant about online security. The experience that the project strives to create is one that is both engaging and informative. The sound piece is structured as a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and is designed to take the listener on a journey that evokes emotions such as fear, anxiety, and ultimately, relief. The sound effects and descriptive language used in the piece aim to create a realistic and immersive experience that allows the listener to put themselves in the shoes of the protagonist and feel the impact of being scammed.

## Process

### Asset Making Process (Audacity and Adobe Photoshop)

All of the dialogues were recorded as original sound pieces, which then were modified on Audacity audio editing software. We have spent a significant amount of time and effort to leverage different effects, plug-ins and extra features to manipulate and remix the audio to achieve the immersive effect. Fade out and fade in are audio techniques we used in our sound project to transition between different segments of a composition, or to create a particular atmosphere or effect. We also used normalization to adjust the different volumes and characteristics of the sound. Additionally, the envelope tool in Audacity was used to adjust the volume of an audio track over time. It allows the user to create a smooth transition between different volume levels, and can be used to add dynamics and depth to an audio recording. The envelope tool works by creating a "control line" that represents the volume level of the audio track at different points in time. By adjusting the control line, the user can increase or decrease the volume of the audio track at specific points in the recording. Another important feature was Noise Reduction which allowed us to remove the background noise of AC and any other unnecessary noise sources to achieve the high quality audio.

### Design, UX, and Web Implementation 

We decided to use JavaScript libraries (GSAP and Scrollmagic animation libraries)  because Abraiz had already used them for a previous homework, and we decided that using a library we are familiar with would be a good call both in terms of saving time, as well as a better look for the website itself. We divided each panel into its own ‘timeline’ and decided what needed to ‘slide in’ and when. We wanted to have the user interact with the website to develop the story, so we decided to make the user ‘drink’ and ‘throw’ the bottle so they can feel as though the story is a consequence to their action - adding to the message. The first scroll is activated by clicking the bottle, then the rest of the scrolls need to be done by the user (as instructed). Another interaction we added was the buttons to make the text appear and disappear as the user sees fit.

## Reflection/Evaluation

In our opinion through "The Scam!" project we are pushing ourselves creatively by approaching the issue of online scamming in a new and engaging way. We can confidently say that our expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version. We were able to fully achieve the set goals of our initial concept and even enhance it with additional features like better UI/UX, more web interaction and better sound effects. Instead of just presenting facts and figures about the problem, we are using a story-based approach to create an emotional connection with the audience. This approach requires creative storytelling techniques that can keep the audience engaged throughout the journey. We had to come up with a compelling story that would not only capture the listener's attention but also make them emotionally invested in the outcome. This involves careful planning, writing, and scripting of the sound piece to create a cohesive and engaging narrative. In addition to storytelling, we are also pushing ourselves creatively by using sound design to create an immersive experience for the listener. This includes creating soundscapes, sound effects, and music that complement the story and help to create a realistic and believable environment. This requires technical expertise and creativity to come up with sounds that accurately reflect the story's setting and atmosphere. We also added a couple of “funny sound elements” which suit the different kinds of atmospheres present in our project. Finally, we designed a site that perfectly aligns with the tone and content of the audio. It allows a user to experience it from a personal perspective which is essential to raising awareness.
