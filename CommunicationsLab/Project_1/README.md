# Project #1 - Communications Lab
Project #1 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

[30 MFF](https://abraiz01.github.io/CommunicationsLab/Project_1/index.html)

## Description:

During our first class at Communications Lab, we were asked to pair up with a partner from class and we were given 30 minutes to come up with an idea for a 90-second video, shoot it, and edit it - The 30 Minute Film Festival (30MFF). It was quite a lot of stuff to do in 30 minutes but me and my partner Majid managed to come up with our "masterpiece" at the end. Our task for this assignment was to create a website for our 30MFF video using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br/><br/>
