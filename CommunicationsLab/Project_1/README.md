# Project #1 - Communications Lab
Project #1 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

[30 MFF](https://abraiz01.github.io/CommunicationsLab/Project_1/index.html)

## Description:

During our first class at Communications Lab, we were asked to pair up with a partner from class and we were given 30 minutes to come up with an idea for a 90-second video, shoot it, and edit it - The 30 Minute Film Festival (30MFF). It was quite a lot of stuff to do in 30 minutes but me and my partner Majid managed to come up with our "masterpiece" at the end. Our task for this assignment was to create a website for our 30MFF video using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Being a big fan of Dark Theme, I thought why not go on implementing that in my first website for this class. I feel like it gives a very professional feel to a weebsite and it really adds to the "cinematic" theme that I was going for in this project. For that, I was very careful in choosing the right colors for the dark theme so that it neither becomes too overwhelming nor very subtle. Once I got a hang of the theme, I decided that the kind of user interactions I was going to implement on my website were scrolling animations. I am always intrigued by websites that make good use of scrolling animations like the one at Dbrand or Apple, and I thought I'd go on and implement that in my own website as well to make the website's experience appear more smooth and professional.<br/><br/>
